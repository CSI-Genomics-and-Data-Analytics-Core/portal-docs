# Introduction

[**CloudFlow**](https://www.pipeline.gedac.org/) is a web-based platform for facilitating computational biology research at the Cancer Science Institute (CSI).  The platform provides principal investigators, staff and students at CSI with easy access to best-practice bioinformatic pipelines that run in the cloud.  The pipelines are completely open-source and actively developed, maintained and tested by a consortium of dedicated researchers and engineers belonging to the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) community.

## Key Features

### ⚡ ️On-demand
Computing resources needed to provision pipelines are **always available** and **accessible**, making it possible to run pipelines at any time without needing to wait in a queue.

### 🚀 Scalable 
Pipelines can be scaled to handle a **few samples** or a **few hundred samples**.  No matter what your study design or sample size is, we've got your back.

### 🔑 Accessible
Pipelines are run using a point-and-click interface, so users are **not required** to have any **command-line** or **advanced computing experience** to get started.
