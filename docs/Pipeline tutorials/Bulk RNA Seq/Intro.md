# Introduction

The **Bulk RNA Seq** pipeline processes data produced from mRNA, total RNA and targeted RNA libraries.

The pipeline performs **quality control**, **read trimming**, **sequence alignment** and **transcript quantification**.

The primary output of the pipeline is a **count matrix** that can be used for differential gene expression.
