# Introduction

The **Single Cell RNA Seq** pipeline processes data produced from 10X Genomics 3’ Gene Expression libraries.  

The pipeline uses a popular bioinformatics program called [**CellRanger**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest) to process and analyze raw sequencing data.  

The primary output of the pipeline is a **count matrix** that can be used for clustering, cell typing and differential gene expression.
