# Next Steps

At this point, you should have everything you need to **perform downstream analysis** using your favorite **software packages**.

If you are unsure where to start, please consider contacting one of our statisticians for **[data analysis support](../tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions.md)**.

If you would like to perform the analysis yourself or learn more about it, we have compiled a list of helpful resources below.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/CSI-Genomics-and-Data-Analytics-Core/portal-docs/issues)
