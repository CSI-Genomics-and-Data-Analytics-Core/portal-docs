# Introduction

The **Nanopore RNA Seq** pipeline processes data produced from Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing libraries.

The pipeline performs **quality control**, **read trimming**, **sequence alignment** and long read **transcript quantification**.

The primary output of the pipeline is a **count matrix** that can be used for differential gene expression and methylation analysis.
