# Introduction

The **Small RNA Seq** pipeline processes data produced from Illumina, NextFlex and QiaSeq libraries.

The pipeline performs **quality control**, **read trimming**, **sequence alignment** and **miRNA quantification**.

The primary output of the pipeline is a **count matrix** that can be used for differential gene expression.
